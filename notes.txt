Nodejs 

It is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 javascript engine. Allows you
to run javavscript outside of the browser. It is a popular backend language.

It is:

- Event Driven, non-blocking I/O that makes it lightweight and efficient
	- Non-blocking: While there is an input or output operation, other
	operations are still able to run.
- It is single-threaded because it uses non-blocking I/O
- You could implement tasks in the same time howerver, you need multiple threads

          (Event loop)  \        ```
                Callback Stack
